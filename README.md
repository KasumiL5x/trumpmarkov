# Trump Tweets Generator
> A simple generator in the style of Trump's tweets.

Uses the [Markovify](https://pypi.org/project/markovify/) library along with processed Tweets from the [Trump Twitter Archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com) to generate Tweets in the style of Donald Trump.  Nothing fancy, but it's entertaining.

The `flask` folder contains a distribution for the flask web API.  If using this, do not forget to upload `tweets.json` for processing.

Enjoy!
