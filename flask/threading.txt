Threading issue discussed on SO:
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17053671/python-how-do-you-stop-numpy-from-multithreading
In particular, this answer:
	https://stackoverflow.com/a/48665619/2074002

In short, add the following environment variables:
	export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
	export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1

The reason that it crashed was that the server doesn't allow for multithreaded python, and by default numpy (and/or something else) is multithreaded.
